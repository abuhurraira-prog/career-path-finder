		The Introduction (The "Who")
"I am a Final Year Computer Science student at Govt Graduate College Samundar, currently in my 8th semester. My passion lies in bridging the gap between education and industry through technology. Career Path Finder is the culmination of my academic journey, serving as my Final Year Project."
	</p>

	<p>
		The Project Vision (The "Why")
"The transition from student to professional is often filled with uncertainty. Many students possess technical skills but struggle to identify which industry role—be it Data Science, Full-Stack Development, or AI Research—best suits their profile. My vision is to build an AI-driven platform that analyzes a student's technical strengths and interests to provide a personalized career roadmap."
	</p>

	<p>
	The Tech Stack (The "How")
"To ensure scalability and performance, I am building this platform using modern web technologies:

Frontend: Developed with Astro for a fast, content-driven user experience.

Backend: Utilizing Flask and MySQL to handle user data and logic.

Analysis: Implementing Python-based libraries to process student data and generate career suggestions."
